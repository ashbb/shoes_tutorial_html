Trying to ease the RubyGems pain
--------------------------------

\_why announced that he is trying to ease the RubyGems pain.

Some issues are:

 + RubyGems doesn't have a GUI.
 + Shoes users shouldn't be expected to use the commandline.
   (So, no `gem install twitter`.)
 + Shoes users shouldn't need admin rights to use a lib.
 + Shoes needs to include SQLite3, for the image cache.
 + And I like having Hpricot and JSON.



The hpricot, sqlite3, json gems <br>
