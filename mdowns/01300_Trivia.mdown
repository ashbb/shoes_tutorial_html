Trivia

list\_box needs to set :height explicitly
----------------------------------------

	# sample91.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 300, :height => 60 do
	  button('OK'){@msg.text = @e.text}
	  @e = list_box :items => ['blue', 'red', 'yellow'], :height => 30
	  @msg = para ''
	end

Try to comment out :height => 30 and run. <br>
The list\_box doesn't show the items. <br>
This strange behavior occurs only on Windows. On Mac OS X, it doesn't. <br>

This OS X information was provided by George Thompson. <br>


strange mouse event behavior
--------------------------------

	# sample92.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 150, :height => 100 do
	  @msg = para ''
	  nostroke
	 
	  @img = image :width => 20, :height => 20, :left => 30, :top => 30 do
	    oval :radius => 10, :fill => red
	  end
	  @img.hover{ @msg.replace 'hello' }
	  @img.leave{ @msg.replace '' }
	 
	  @o = oval :left => 60, :top => 60, :radius => 10, :fill => blue
	  @o.hover{ @msg.replace 'hi' }
	  @o.leave{ @msg.replace '' }
	end

The image (red) oval works the mouse hovering feature but the blue doesn't. <br>
This behavior is a bug. But it is fixed in the latest Shoes-0.r970 and later. <br>

Shoes was born July 31st, 2007. 
-------------------------------

Yes, July 31st is Shoes' birthday and it is now one year old.


Shoes wiki
----------

A new Shoes wiki was launched on Sep 12th, 2008. <br>
  <http://github.com/why/shoes/wikis> <br>
The old one was retired. Now linked to the Shoes Official Homepage. <br>

Built-in sample apps
--------------------

See the following directory (in Windows XP with Shoes-0.r1057) <br>
There are many sample code. Let's hack! <br>

The Rules Of Shoes and UTF-8 Everywhere

Shoes scope can be a bit confusing... <br>
Shoes supports UTF-8 everywhere. Can't wait to get the next build. <br>

Lovely creatures
----------------

Lovely creatures in this tutorial were created by Anita Kuno. <br>
Each creature has his/her own name. <br>
  purple is loogink <br>
  green is  Cy <br>
  brown is Yar <br>
  blue is kamome <br>
  white is shaha <br>

	# sample93.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 400, :height => 75, :title => 'Lovely Creaturs' do
	  background "#D0A".."#F90", :angle => 90
	  x = 0
	  creatures = %w(loogink yar cy kamome shaha).collect{|c| image "../images/#{c}.png", :left => x += 60}
	                    
	  messages =<<-EOS
	Thx for reading. :)
	See you!
	Enjoy Ruby and Shoes!
	EOS
	  messages = messages.split("\n")
	
	  msg = subtitle '', :top => 30, :stroke => white
	  animate(3) do
	    creatures.each{|c| c.move c.left, rand(15)}
	  end
	  
	  creatures.each do |c|
	    c.hover{msg.text = strong messages[rand(messages.length)]}
	    c.leave{msg.text = ''}
	  end
	end

Policeman
---------

The sample91.rb and sample92.rb worked with Shoes-0.r1263 as same as Raisins.

Replace `String#to_a` to `String#split` for Ruby 1.9. Then the sample93.rb also worked well.
