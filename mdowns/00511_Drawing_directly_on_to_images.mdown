Drawing directly on to images
-----------------------------

We can draw some elements on to the images. <br>
In the below sample app, Cy (green creature) has a star! <br>


	# sample25.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 250, :height => 76 do
	  background lightsalmon
	  icon = image :width => 74, :height => 74 do
	    oval :width => 70, :height => 70, :fill => lightskyblue,
	          :stroke => red, :left => 2, :top => 2
	  end
	  icon.image '../images/cy.png', :left => 10, :top => 8
	  icon.star 35, 45, 5, 8, 3, :fill => hotpink, :stroke => nil
	  msg = para '', :stroke => white
	  
	  icon.hover do
	    @a = animate do
	      button, left, top = self.mouse
	      msg.replace strong icon[left, top]
	    end
	  end
	  icon.leave do
	    @a.stop
	    msg.replace ''
	  end
	end

In the case of Shoes-0.r970, you need doing the mouse leaving once. After that it works well. <br>
In the case of Shoes-0.r1057, no need to do that.
