First step
----------

A good starting point for working with Shoes is the [tutorial written by \_why](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_walkthrough).

If you want to experiment, you can copy and paste the 16 sample programs and run them one by one. Don't worry if you don't understand the code yet, just run it and see what happens to the app windows. Although the tutorial does have screenshots, running the samples and maybe playing around with them is a good start to Shoes programming. So do it now, it will help you a lot in understanding this tutorial you are reading right now.


Tip: Quick launch Shoes from the shell
--------------------------------------
Add the following line to your .bashrc (create it if the file doesn't exist):

	alias shoes='/Applications/Shoes.app/Contents/MacOS/shoes'
	# your path might be different....

Now you can launch a Shoes app from a terminal window like this, thus avoiding going through the open file dialog:

	shoes sample1.rb

Tip: For users of Ubuntu 8.10
-----------------------------
The documentation is no longer correct. It was for Ubuntu 8.04.
For Ubuntu 8.10, the required libraries are libvlc-dev and libvlccore-dev instead of libvlc0-dev.

Information about Kate
----------------------

I use **Kate (Kubuntu 8.04 text editor)** and it has support for a number of programming languages and a feature that opens a terminal at the bottom of the text area (this height can be adjusted too).

Another thing I like about this is that the terminal *is* attached to the editor *and* if you've moved to another directory just close the terminal and open it to be at the new directory.

You may use if you like.
