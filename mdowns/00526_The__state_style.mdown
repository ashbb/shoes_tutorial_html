The :state style
----------------

The :state style is for disabling or locking certain controls if you do not want them to be edited. 

	# sample42.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 400, :height => 410 do
	  src = IO.read($PROGRAM_NAME)
	  background deepskyblue
	  
	  stack do
	    caption strong ":state >> string"
	    para '# sample42.rb'
	  end
	  
	  eb = edit_box :text => src, :width => 1.0, :height => 0.75, :state => 'readonly'
	  
	  button('edit'){eb.state = eb.state ? nil : 'readonly'}
	  
	  b1 = button 'save', :state => 'disabled' do
	    file = ask_save_file
	    open(file, 'wb'){|f| f.puts eb.text}  if file
	  end
	  
	  b2 = button 'password' do
	    pw = ask 'Enter your password: ', :secret => true
	    (b1.state = nil; b2.state = 'disabled')  if pw == 'Ruby&Shoes'
	  end
	end

I had used ARGV[0] to get the file name. But it's not correct usage.
We have to use $0 or $PROGRAM\_NAME instead of ARGV[0].
