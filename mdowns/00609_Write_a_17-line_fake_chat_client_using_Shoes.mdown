Write a 17-line fake chat client using Shoes
--------------------------------------------
At first I have to say my apologies in advance. This is a FAKE chat client. It's useless so far. Just for fun. ;-)

This is a great blog. I was inspired. Thanks to Paul Harris. He tweeted me.

	# sample70.rb
	%w[ashbb Paul Max].each do |name|
	  blk = lambda do
	    self.clipboard = ''
	    ed = edit_line
	    button('ok'){self.clipboard = "#{name}: #{ed.text}"}
	    slot = stack
	    msg = ''
	    every 1 do
	      slot.append do
	        tmp = clipboard
	        para tmp unless msg == tmp
	        msg = tmp
	      end
	    end
	  end
	
	  Shoes.app :title => name, :width => 300, :height => 500, &blk
	end

The sample70.rb worked well with Shoes-0.r1263
