Classes List and Colors List
----------------------------

We can see the colors list in the built-in manual. <br>
But we will also be able to see them by the following sample code. <br>

	# sample30.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 642, :height => 700, :resizable => false do
	  COLORS.keys.map{|sym|sym.to_s}.sort.each do |color|
	    flow :width => 160, :height => 20 do
	      c = send(color)
	      fill c
	      rect 0, 0, 160, 20
	      inscription color, :stroke => c.dark? ? white : black
	    end
	  end
	end

_why is thinking about some more method related colors. <br>
e.g.  invert, dark?, light?, black?, white?, opaque?, transparent? <br>
We might be able to get them in the near future. <br>
