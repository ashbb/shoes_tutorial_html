Assignment 6 Dog Hunts Sheep Game
---------------------------------

Create your own **Dog Hunts Sheep Game** by doing the following five steps.

1. A sheep running in the grass farm.

	+ Use [this pic](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/raw/master/images/pasture.jpg) as the background.
	+ A sheep runs from the bottom of the window to the top.
	+ The sheep stops at the top.

2. There are twenty-five sheep and one dog

	+ Twenty-five sheep run at various speed or stop a while.
	+ Dog moves with the arrow keys.

3. Dog woofs sheep

	+ Dog woofs at sheep when and where he catches sheep.
	+ 'Woofs!' will vanish after a while.

4. Dog catches sheep and sends them where they belong!

	+ A deepskyblue star appears when and where the dog catches a sheep.
	+ The sheep return where they belong.

5. Finish the game

	+ Sheep say 'baa!' at the top.
	+ The game finishes when all the sheep reach the top of the window or return the bottom.

	  sheeps = []
	  25.times{|i| sheeps << sheep(30 + 15 * i)}
	  
	  dog = oval 300, 210, 25, :fill => yellow, :strokewidth => 3
	  keypress do |key|
	    x, y = 0, 0
	    case key
	      when :up then y = -15
	      when :down then y = 15
	      when :left then x = -15
	      when :right then x = 15
	      else
	    end
	    dog.move dog.left + x, dog.top + y
	    sheeps.each{|s| dog_catch_sheep(s) if [dog.left, dog.top] == s.pos}
	    reached = 0
	    sheeps.each{|s| reached += 1 if s.pos[1] == -5}
	    alert("Dog caught #{@caught} sheep.") or exit if @caught + reached == 25
	  end
	end

Have fun!

Replaced `Widget` to `Shoes::Widget`. Then the sample68.rb worked well with Shoes-0.r1263.
