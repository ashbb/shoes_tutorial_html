Trivia

list_box needs to set :height explicitly
----------------------------------------

	# sample91.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 300, :height => 60 do
	  button('OK'){@msg.text = @e.text}
	  @e = list_box :items => ['blue', 'red', 'yellow'], :height => 30
	  @msg = para ''
	end

Try to comment out :height => 30 and run. <br>
The list_box doesn't show the items. <br>
But this strange behavior occurs only on Windows. On Mac OS X, it doesn't. <br>

This OS X information was provided by George Thompson. <br>


wonder the mouse event behavior
--------------------------------

	# sample92.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 150, :height => 100 do
	  @msg = para ''
	  nostroke
	 
	  @img = image :width => 20, :height => 20, :left => 30, :top => 30 do
	    oval :radius => 10, :fill => red
	  end
	  @img.hover{ @msg.replace 'hello' }
	  @img.leave{ @msg.replace '' }
	 
	  @o = oval :left => 60, :top => 60, :radius => 10, :fill => blue
	  @o.hover{ @msg.replace 'hi' }
	  @o.leave{ @msg.replace '' }
	end

The image (red) oval works the mouse hovering feature but the blue doesn't. <br>
This behavior is a bug. But it is fixed in the latest Shoes-0.r970. <br>
