optional arguments
------------------

When we create an oval shape, like <br>
    oval :left => 50, :top => 50, :width => 30 <br>
The :left and :top positions are the top-left corner of the oval. <br>

But we create an star shape, like <br>
    star :left => 50, :top => 50, :points => 5, :outer => 15, :inner => 10 <br>
The :left and :top positions are the center of the star.  <br>
A bit strange behavior... <br>

	# sample40.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 330, :height => 150 do
	  nofill
	  strokewidth 2
	  oval 50, 50, 50, :stroke => blue
	  rect 150, 50, 50, 50, :stroke => green
	  star 250, 50, 5, 30, 20, :stroke => black
	  oval 50, 50, 1, :stroke => red, :fill => red
	  oval 150, 50, 1, :stroke => red, :fill => red
	  oval 250, 50, 1, :stroke => red, :fill => red
	 end

We can use the :center option to specify the coordinates. But it works well only in the case of the oval and rect, not the star method. If we add an undefined option like :oops as one of the arguments, no error will occur and nothing will happen, it will just be ignored.

I don't know if this behavior is a spec or a bug...

	# sample40-1.rb
	Shoes.app  do
	  stack :width => 0.3 do
	    nofill
	    strokewidth 2
	    oval 50, 50, 1, :stroke => red, :fill => red
	    @o = oval 50, 50, 50, :stroke => blue, :center => false, :oops => true
	    @p1 = para '', :top => 150
	  end
	  
	  stack :width => 0.3 do
	    nofill
	    strokewidth 2
	    oval 50, 50, 1, :stroke => red, :fill => red
	    @r = rect 50, 50, 50, 50, :stroke => green, :center => true, :oops => true
	    @p2 = para '', :top => 150
	  end
	  
	  stack :width => 0.4 do
	    nofill
	    strokewidth 2
	    oval 50, 50, 1, :stroke => red, :fill => red
	    @s = star 50, 50, 5, 30, 20, :stroke => black, :center => false, :oops => true
	    @p3 = para '', :top => 150
	  end
	  
	  @p1.text = @o.style.map{|e| e.join(': ')}.sort.join("\n")
	  @p2.text = @r.style.map{|e| e.join(': ')}.sort.join("\n")
	  @p3.text = @s.style.map{|e| e.join(': ')}.sort.join("\n")
	end

In the above sample40-1, the oval and rect methods accepted the :center option, but the star method ignored it as it ignored the undefined option :oops.
