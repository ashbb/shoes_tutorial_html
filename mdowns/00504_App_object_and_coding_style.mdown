App object and coding style
---------------------------

A Shoes App object is a single window running code at a Shoes URL. When you switch Shoes URLs, a new App object is created. The App itself is a flow. There are four Shoes App object coding styles:

	# sample16.rb
	Shoes.app :width => 150, :height => 40 do
	  para 'Hello world!', :align => 'center'
	end

	# sample17.rb
	class Hello < Shoes
	  url '/', :index
	  
	  def index
	    para 'Hello world!', :align => 'center'
	  end
	end
	
	Shoes.app :width => 150, :height => 40 

 # sample17.png
is the same as the above sample16.png.


	# sample18.rb
	class Shoes::Hello < Shoes::Widget
	  def initialize
	    para 'Hello World!', :align => 'center'
	  end
	end
	
	Shoes.app :width => 150, :height => 40 do
	  hello
	end

 # sample18.png
is the same as the above sample16.png.


	# sample47.rb
	blk = proc{para 'Hello world!', :align => 'center'}
	
	Shoes.app :width => 150, :height => 40, &blk

 # sample47.png
is the same as the above sample16.png.

Open question: when to use one coding style over another? <br>
*This question is provided by Jose Carlos Monteiro - Saturday, 15 November 2008, POIRPWSC101-1I*

Year, good point! <br>
I think there is no principles (no constraint), but I usually select like the following.

a) Sample 16 style <br>
is most easy and simple. I like best. <br>
So, I recommend you this style for the exercise 1 - day 2.

b) Sample 17 style <br>
is a special style for using Shoes URLs. <br>
Please refer to [No. 9: Shoes.url](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/tree/master/mdowns/00409_No.9_Shoes.url.mdown)

c) Sample 18 style <br>
is a special style for using Shoes Widget class. <br>
Please refer to [the Widget class](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/tree/master/mdowns/00508_the_Widget_class.mdown) <br>
And more information, but advanced article, is [here](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/tree/master/mdowns/00900_Appendix.mdown)

d) Sample 47 style <br>
is a special style for using block or proc object. <br>
Please refer to [Open a new app window (Another example)](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/tree/master/mdowns/00530_Open_a_new_app_window.mdown)

NOTE
----
Phew,... went directly into advanced topic....

The aboves are curious things. But I recommend you to learn Shoes step by step.
Because Shoes is a developing project. Not so stable, hence there are many bugs and strang behaviors. If you stick on them, you will feel _'Shoes is not so fun'._ I think it's not good.
__Shoes is fun!__
