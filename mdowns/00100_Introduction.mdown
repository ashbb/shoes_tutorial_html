Introduction

Shoes is a tiny cross-platform graphics and windowing toolkit for the Ruby programming language written by [\_why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff).

All sample programs and data files in this tutorial can be downloaded from [here](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial/tree/master).

Some sample programs are taken from chapter 8 of [NKS](http://hackety.org/press/nks.html) (Nobody Knows Shoes, the first publicly available manual for Shoes).
