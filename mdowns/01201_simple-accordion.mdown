	There is a thought
	I have just had
	Which I dont care to pass to
	Anyone at all at this time.
	
	I have even forgotten it now,
	But kept only the pleasures
	Of my property
	And of my controlled mental slippage.
	END
	  page "0.1", <<-'END'
	My eyes have blinked again
	And I have just realized
	This upright world
	I have been in.
	
	My eyelids wipe
	My eyes hundreds of times
	Reseting and renovating
	The scenery.
	END
	  page "0.2", <<-'END'
	Sister, without you,
	The universe would
	Have such a hole through it,
	Where infinity has been shot.
	
	This cannot be, though.
	There will always be room
	For you-all of us are
	Holding the way open.
	END

Study Note
----------
\#1: <br>
- The `app.slot` is the Shoes window itself. It's a flow. 
- The contents is the Shoes method lists all elements in a slot. 
  Refer to: <http://help.shoooes.net/Traversing.html>
- `x.contents[1]` is the stack which is defined at #9. `x.contents[0]` is the stack which is defined at #6.

\#2: <br>
See `ri Enumerable#detect`.

\#3: <br>
This stack is a local variable (an argument of open\_page method)

\#4: <br>
This active is a page clicked.

\#5: <br>
Same as the following.

	s = stack do
	  # bla bla bla
	end
	@pages << s

\#8: <br>
In this case, there is no need to use a link. It's enough just like this:

	para title, :size => 26

Because the perception about mouse hover/leave is doing with background element (#7).

\#9: <br>
If you don't need to open the first page as a default, just write like this:

	stack :width => "100%", :height => 0 do

\#11: <br>
Why split by two new lines? Do the following snippet.

	Shoes.app :width => 150, :height => 450 do
	  flow do
	    5.times{para "test test test\n"}
	  end
	  stack do
	    5.times{para "test test test\n"}
	  end
	end

There is a difference between stack and flow. Because... <br>
<http://www.mail-archive.com/shoes@code.whytheluckystiff.net/msg02869.html>

In this case, we can write like this instead of #10 and #11.

	flow :margin => 10 do
	  text.each do |pg|

\#12: <br>
The extend method is used to add two methods, open\_page and page, as instance methods into Shoes.app object. See `ri Object#extend`.

\#13 and #14: <br>
Change the default style for the link method. But there is no need to use a link in this case. See the above explanation about #8.

\#15: <br>
Using [here document](http://web.njit.edu/all_topics/Prog_Lang_Docs/html/ruby/syntax.html#here_doc).
Check the usage of '(single quote), "(double quote) and -(hyphen).
