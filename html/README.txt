This subdirectory is used to store .html files created by the tool: mkhtml.rb

Run the following command line on the console (terminal) window.

  C:\> ruby mkhtml.rb

Then it'll create .html files here.

You can read whole Shoes Tutorial Note offline.
And you can run whole sample apps with Shoes, too. :-D
