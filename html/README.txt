This subdirectory is used to store .html files created by the tools: mkhtml.rb and mkbightml.rb

Run the following command lines on the console (terminal) window.

  C:\> ruby mkhtml.rb

Then it'll create .html files here.

  C:\> ruby mkbightml.rb

Then it'll create ShoesTutorialNote.html file here. It includes whole contents in one big html file. This big html file is useful for transforming to PDF.


You can read whole Shoes Tutorial Note offline.
And you can run whole sample apps with Shoes, too. :-D
